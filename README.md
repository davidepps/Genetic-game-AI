# Genetic-game-AI
I was given a game and API and I wrote a genetic algorithm to generate an agent with 525 chromosomes (MyAgent.py . using a fitness function based heavily on survival i generate a set of 
50 agents at the end of the game and rank them by fitness to create 50 new agents using a tournement selection to get both parents. I then splice the parents chromosomes 
upon a random index. finally there is a probality that each  that each chromosone will be mutated at random to impliment genetic drift.
